If you have done any work already, put your component in this folder. Feel free to edit the name of your folder to change it to whatever you like! Just make sure you do not make any changes in the main branch. ONLY do work in your personal branch!

Look through the App.js file to find a place to add your component.

Don't forget to edit the <Link> tag next to one of the Cards to make that card redirect to your component.

Any questions? Just ask and the group can help sort things out!

### Issues to iron out:
1. My component renders above the rest of the website, instead of removing homepage and then displaying.

2. The cards do not look great being wrapped in a <Link> tag. Maybe we can find another way to link instead of just wrapping the entire card with the <Link> tag. <a>'s or <button>'s maybe?

3. The photos we use for the carousel need to be the same size. If they are not, the page resizes based on the size of the current photo.

4. Some of the link, specifically in the dropdown and the top do not work for some reason. Clicking 'Colton' takes me to a 404 Error Page.
